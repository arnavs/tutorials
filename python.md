## Project/Repo Structure
It is worth your effort to standardize on repository structures to make analysis/collaboration/reproducibility easier.
- See https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/  for a datascience oriented structure.  It doesn't always apply for every economics project, but follow it if you can
- A bigger framework for setting up solid ML/datascience pipelines is https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ 
- Do not invent your own structure! 


A few tricks:
- When  `code black` is installed as the default in vscode, `<Ctrl-Shift-P>` to find `Format` or choose `Shift-Alt-F` to format with the standard 
- `<Shift-Enter>` in a `.py` file will run the python in an interactive window or terminal
