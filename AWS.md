## Setting up AWS
General sign-up instructions:
1. Sign up for Free Tier https://aws.amazon.com/free  which gives you credits for cheap instances
2. Sign up for https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/ in order to get free $100 cloud credits and other materials

## Using Pre-built UBC Economics ECS2 Images
TBD

## Using Amazon Images

If you are doing a lot of deep-learning with tensorflow/keras, require GPUs, etc. consider the DLAMI
- See https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/get-started-with-deep-learning-using-the-aws-deep-learning-ami/ for instructions.

## On signing up
(1) When you sign up for the free option there are two options: (1) Personal, (2) Professional

(2) The next step requires your credit card information, which I am not sure I should provide that information

## On signing up for AWS Educate
(1) Go to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/)

(2) Click on Join AWS Educate 

(3) Choose student (if student), Educator (if educator), etc.

(4) Fill out the info. It is important to use the email that is given to you by the institution you choose in the form. Some UBC students
(like me) the email an alumni email (something like someone@alumni.ubc.ca). Do not use that email, because in the verification process they would think you are not a student anymore. Therefore, you have to provide a copy of your student id. Note that this step doesnt require a credit card information.

(5) After that you will recieve an email to confirm your email address.
If you have a problem contact their customer service at [AWS: Contact us](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/contact-us/). They are highly effiecient, for my case their average response time for me was on average 2 hours.

(6) Wait for your application to be approved (it should not take more than 24 hours). You will recieve an email to to set your password and log in to the AWS Educate Student Portal.
